# Analytics Configuration
# Uncomment and set your PostHog API key to enable analytics
# Get your API key from https://app.posthog.com/project/settings
# VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_api_key_here

# Development Notes:
# - PostHog analytics are automatically disabled in development mode
# - If you don't set VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, you'll see a warning in the console but the app will work normally
# - Only set this in production if you want to track user analytics
